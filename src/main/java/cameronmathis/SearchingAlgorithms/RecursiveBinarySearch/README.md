# RecursiveBinarySearch

## Algorithm details

Binary Search searches a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It begins with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. It then repeatedly checks until the value is found or the interval is empty. Binary Search usually runs in O(log(n)) time complexity and has an auxiliary space complexity of O(1).
