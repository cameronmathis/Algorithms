# QuickSort

## Algorithm details

Quick sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from an unsorted portion of the array and putting it at the beginning. Quick Sort usually runs in O(nLog(n)) time complexity, but in the worst case (when the partition process always picks greatest or smallest element as pivot) it runs in (n^2) time complexity. Quick sort has a space complexity of O(Log(n)). Quick sort is an unstable sorting algorithm.
