# Sorting algorithms

Implemented:

- Bubble Sort
- Heap Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort

Need to Implement:

- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort

## Setup

In order to run, clone this repo onto your local machine. Once you have navigated to the project folder, run the command:

> ./run.sh [Array Size] [Show/Hide Array]

Example:

> ./run.sh 10000 hide

Parameter restraints: Array Size - any positive integer value (suggested value: ~100,000) | Show/Hide Array - the string "show" or the string "hide" (without quotation marks) </br>
This will print out how long it took each algorithm to sort the same randomly generated array of given size.

## Status

Project is: _in progress_
