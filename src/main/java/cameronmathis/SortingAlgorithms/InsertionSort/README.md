# InsertionSort

## Algorithm details

Insertion sort works by splitting the array into sorted and an unsorted parts and then placing values from the unsorted part at the correct position in the sorted part. Insertion Sort runs in O(n^2) time complexity (unless the array is already sorted, then it is O(n)) and has an auxiliary space complexity of O(1). Insertion sort is a stable sorting algorithm.
