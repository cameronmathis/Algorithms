# MergeSort

## Algorithm details

Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that works dividing the input array in two halves, calling itself for the two halves and then merging the two sorted halves. Merge Sort always runs in O(nLog(n)) time complexity and has an auxiliary space complexity of O(n). Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm.
