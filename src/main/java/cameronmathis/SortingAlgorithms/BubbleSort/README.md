# BubbleSort

## Algorithm details

Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. Bubble Sort usually runs in O(n^2) time complexity, but runs in O(n) time complexity if the array is already sorted. It has an auxiliary space complexity of O(1). Bubble sort is a stable sorting algorithm.
