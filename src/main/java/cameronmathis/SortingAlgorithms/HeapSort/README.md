# HeapSort

## Algorithm details

Heap sort works similar to selection sort by first finding the maximum element and placing the maximum element at the end of the array. It repeats the same process for the remaining elements. Heap Sort runs in O(nLog(n)) time complexity and has an auxiliary space complexity of O(1). Heap sort is an unstable sorting algorithm.
