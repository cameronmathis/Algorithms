# SelectionSort

## Algorithm details

Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from an unsorted portion of the array and putting it at the beginning. Selection Sort always runs in O(n^2) time complexity and has an auxiliary space complexity of O(1). Selection sort is an unstable sorting algorithm.
