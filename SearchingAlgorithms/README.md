## General info
This is a project I did in order to practice implementing searching algorithms. In order to run and learn more about each individual algorithm, navigate to the appropriate algorithm folder. You can also follow the setup instructions on this README to run all algorithms at once.

## Searching algorithms
Implemented:
* Linear Search
* Recursive Binary Search
* Iterative Binary Search

## Setup
In order to run, clone this repo onto your local machine. Once you have navigated to the project folder, run the command:

	$ ./run.sh [Array Size] [Element]

Parameter restraints: Array Size - any comma separated integer array (without spaces) | Element - the element to find </br>

_* Note: Binary Search only works on sorted arrays_

## Status
Project is: _finished_

## Language details
Language used: Java </br>
Version used: 11.0.8
